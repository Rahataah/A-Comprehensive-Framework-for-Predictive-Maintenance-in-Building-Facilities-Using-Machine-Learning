## A Comprehensive Framework for Predictive Maintenance in Building Facilities Using Machine Learning

This research dashboard delivers end-to-end analytical and predictive capabilities for facility management and building engineering. It transforms raw maintenance logs into actionable insights, enabling data-driven decisions that improve reliability, reduce costs, and optimize resource allocation.

### Core Capabilities

**📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

* Identify historical trends in work orders and maintenance activities
* Compare cost implications of proactive versus reactive maintenance strategies
* Analyze how building condition (Facility Condition Index, FCI) and weather patterns influence HVAC and system failures

**🤖 Machine Learning Integration**

**Cost Prediction**
Estimate total work order costs using factors such as building age, system type, and temperature conditions.

**Delay Risk Assessment**
Predict the likelihood of significant delays based on component type, labor availability, and operational constraints.

**Building Archetype Clustering**
Group facilities into distinct clusters according to size, condition, and maintenance frequency to support strategic planning and optimized resource deployment.
