# A-Comprehensive-Framework-for-Predictive-Maintenance-in-Building-Facilities-Using-Machine-Learning
This research dashboard provides comprehensive analytical and predictive tools for facility management and building engineering. It bridges the gap between raw maintenance logs and actionable intelligence.
**Core Capabilities:**
        * 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Uncover historical trends in work orders, analyze the cost impact of proactive vs. reactive maintenance, and evaluate how building conditions (FCI) and dynamic weather patterns trigger HVAC and system failures.
        * 🤖 **Machine Learning Integration:** 
            * **Cost Prediction:** Estimate total work order costs based on building age, system type, and temperature ranges.
            * **Delay Risk:** Assess the probability of high delays for specific components and labor constraints.
            * **Building Archetypes:** Group facilities into distinct clusters based on size, condition, and maintenance frequency to optimize resource allocation.
